# Library-System-CLI-Java
A simple yet functional Library Management System built using Core Java. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as object-oriented design, dynamic data storage using ArrayList, and user interaction via the console. It allows users to add, view, issue, return, and search books, simulating a basic command-line library system.
